# UiPath-Utilities

This repository compiles useful code snippets of commonly used and reusable functionalities to make your work more dynamic and efficient.

It is divided into two main sections: Library and Functionalities.

PLEASE NOTE: This project is currently a work in progress.

# Library
It is a dependency that wraps up all the functionalities from the Functionalities/Studio folder into a unique entity so you can have each one of them as available UiPath activities.

What will you find in this namespace?

> Date and time
  - Get day of week
  - Get last working day

> File management
  - Delete files by params
  - Delet temp folder
